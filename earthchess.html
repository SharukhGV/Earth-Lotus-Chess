    <h2>General Rules</h2>
<div>Players start on opposite corners of the board.
 The goal of the game is to get one star (player 1 has star) or one seed (player 2 has seed) to the center of the board. Same type pieces (pieces that move in the same manner like opposing player) cannot eat each other.Only different natured (pieces that move differently) can eat one another
 Pieces cannot jump over one another. To Eat a piece, click from your piece to the space where the piece you want to eat is located. Pieces can block one another, and the game is not restricted so feel free for house rules!</div>
